# Usage Rules

Usage rules provide best practices and conventions directly from package authors to improve how Claude Code writes code for your project.

> üìã **Quick Reference**: See the [Usage Rules Cheatsheet](../cheatsheets/usage-rules.cheatmd) for a concise reference of configuration options and patterns.

## What are Usage Rules?

Usage rules are markdown files containing library-specific guidelines, patterns, and best practices that help AI assistants write better code. When Claude installs in your project, it automatically:

1. Adds the `usage_rules` dependency (dev only)
2. Syncs all available usage rules to your `CLAUDE.md` file
3. Makes these rules available to sub-agents

This ensures Claude Code follows the exact patterns and conventions that library authors recommend.

## How Claude Uses Usage Rules

### Automatic Syncing

When you run `mix claude.install`, Claude automatically runs:

```bash
mix usage_rules.sync CLAUDE.md --all --inline usage_rules:all --link-to-folder deps
```

This command:
- Gathers usage rules from all dependencies that provide them
- Adds them inline to your `CLAUDE.md` file
- Creates links to the source files in `deps/`
- Ensures Claude Code always has access to current best practices

### In Your CLAUDE.md

After installation, your `CLAUDE.md` will contain sections like:

```markdown
## ash usage
_A declarative, extensible framework for building Elixir applications._

[ash usage rules](deps/ash/usage-rules.md)

## phoenix usage
_Productive. Reliable. Fast._

[phoenix usage rules](deps/phoenix/usage-rules.md)

## usage_rules:elixir usage
# Elixir Core Usage Rules

## Pattern Matching
- Use pattern matching over conditional logic when possible
- Prefer to match on function heads instead of using `if`/`else`
...
```

Claude Code reads this file at the start of every session, ensuring it follows these guidelines.

## Nested Memories

Claude supports distributing CLAUDE.md files across different directories in your project for context-specific guidance:

```elixir
%{
  nested_memories: %{
    "lib/my_app_web" => ["phoenix", "ash_phoenix"],
    "lib/my_app/accounts" => ["ash"]
  }
}
```

This creates separate `CLAUDE.md` files in each directory with the relevant usage rules:
- `lib/my_app_web/CLAUDE.md` - Phoenix and Ash Phoenix integration rules for web code
- `lib/my_app/accounts/CLAUDE.md` - Ash framework rules for business logic

Benefits of nested memories:
- **Context-aware guidance** - Different rules for different parts of your codebase
- **Reduced noise** - Claude only sees relevant rules for the current context
- **Better organization** - Keep domain-specific guidance with the code

## Usage Rules in Sub-Agents

Sub-agents can include specific usage rules to ensure they follow library best practices:

```elixir
%{
  subagents: [
    %{
      name: "Code Generation Expert",
      description: "Expert in code generation and project setup",
      prompt: "You are a code generation expert...",
      tools: [:read, :write, :edit],
      usage_rules: [:igniter, :usage_rules_elixir]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Available Usage Rules

Common usage rules that can be included:

- **`:usage_rules_elixir`** - Elixir language best practices
- **`:usage_rules_otp`** - OTP patterns and conventions
- **Package-specific** - Any package that provides usage rules (`:igniter`, or others when available)

### Loading Patterns

Usage rules can be loaded in different ways:

- **`:package_name`** - Loads the main usage rules file (`deps/package_name/usage-rules.md`)
- **`"package_name:all"`** - Loads all usage rules from a package (`deps/package_name/usage-rules/`)
- **`"package_name:specific_rule"`** - Loads a specific rule file (`deps/package_name/usage-rules/specific_rule.md`)

## Benefits

1. **Consistency** - Claude follows the same patterns throughout your codebase
2. **Best Practices** - Automatically uses library author recommendations
3. **Fewer Errors** - Avoids common mistakes and anti-patterns
4. **Better Integration** - Code that works well with your dependencies
5. **Learning** - Usage rules document patterns for your team too

## Examples

### Current Project

This Claude project includes these usage rules which you can see in the [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/bradleygolden/claude/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) file.

### When More Packages Add Usage Rules

As packages add usage rules, they'll automatically be available. For example:

- If Phoenix adds usage rules, you could use `:phoenix`
- If Ecto adds usage rules, you could use `:ecto`
- If Ash adds usage rules, you could use `:ash`

The usage_rules package ecosystem is growing, and more packages are adding rules over time.

## Troubleshooting

**Usage rules not appearing in CLAUDE.md?**
- Check that `usage_rules` is in your dependencies
- Run `mix claude.install`
- Verify packages have `usage-rules.md` or `usage-rules/` directory

**Sub-agent not following usage rules?**
- Verify the rules are listed in the sub-agent's `usage_rules` field
- Check that the package name matches exactly
- Run `mix claude.install` to regenerate sub-agents
