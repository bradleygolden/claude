# 0.6.0 Documentation Update Work Plan

## Current Status Assessment

After reviewing the codebase, I can see that 0.6.0 is already well-documented! Here's what I found:

### âœ… Already Complete

1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Has complete 0.6.0 section with all key features:
   - Plugin System architecture 
   - Reporter System for event logging
   - SessionEnd Hook Event
   - URL Documentation References

2. **README.md** - Already includes:
   - Plugin System section (lines 56-64)
   - Event Reporting mentioned in hooks section (lines 70-74) 
   - Updated configuration example with reporters
   - Recently Added section highlighting all 0.6.0 features (lines 202-220)

3. **Documentation Files Present**:
   - `documentation/guide-plugins.md` - Already exists
   - `documentation/guide-hooks.md` - Already exists
   - `cheatsheets/plugins.cheatmd` - Already exists

## Remaining Work

Need to verify and potentially enhance:

### 1. README.md
- Check if plugin system description is comprehensive
- Ensure new SessionEnd hook is mentioned
- Verify reporter system coverage

### 2. Documentation Guides
- Review `documentation/guide-plugins.md` for completeness
- Check `documentation/guide-hooks.md` for SessionEnd and reporters
- Verify `cheatsheets/plugins.cheatmd` accuracy

### 3. Final Tasks
- Check mix.exs for any needed ExDoc updates
- Review other guides/cheatsheets for consistency

## Key 0.6.0 Features to Validate Coverage

   - `Claude.Plugins.Base` - Standard hooks
   - `Claude.Plugins.ClaudeCode` - Documentation
   - `Claude.Plugins.Phoenix` - Auto-detection with Tidewave

   - `Claude.Plugins.Logging` - Structured logging

2. **Reporter System** 
   - `Claude.Hooks.Reporter` behaviour
   - `Claude.Hooks.Reporters.Webhook` 
   - `Claude.Hooks.Reporters.Jsonl`

3. **SessionEnd Hook Event**
   - New hook for cleanup tasks
   - Session end monitoring

4. **URL Documentation References**
   - `@reference` system with caching
   - Offline access support

## Next Steps

Start by examining existing documentation to see what needs updates vs what's already complete.
