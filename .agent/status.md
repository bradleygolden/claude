# Current Status

## Current Task
Adding port customization support to Phoenix plugin for Tidewave - investigating test failure where installer is overriding plugin's port configuration.

## Progress
- ‚úÖ Fixed nested memories bug: use read_config_with_plugins instead of read_and_eval_claude_exs
- ‚úÖ Fixed non-Phoenix test to expect no changes to .claude.exs file  
- ‚úÖ Run tests again to verify all Phoenix plugin integration works
- üîÑ Add port customization support to Phoenix plugin for Tidewave (IN PROGRESS)

## Current Issue
The port customization feature is implemented but the integration test is failing. The installer is adding `mcp_servers: [:tidewave]` instead of preserving the plugin's `tidewave: [port: "${PORT:-8080}"]` configuration.

The plugin provides: `tidewave: [port: "${PORT:-8080}"]`
But installer outputs: `mcp_servers: [:tidewave]`

Need to debug why `tidewave_already_configured?` is not detecting the plugin's configuration properly.

## Next Steps
1. Debug the tidewave detection logic in add_tidewave_to_mcp_servers
2. Fix the installer to properly preserve plugin port configurations
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Complete port customization feature

## Files Modified
- `lib/claude/plugins/phoenix.ex` - Added port option support
- `lib/claude/nested_memories.ex` - Fixed to use read_config_with_plugins
- `test/claude/plugins/phoenix_test.exs` - Added port customization tests
- `test/mix/tasks/claude.install_test.exs` - Fixed non-Phoenix test, added port test

## Test Status
- All Phoenix plugin unit tests: ‚úÖ PASSING
- Most installer integration tests: ‚úÖ PASSING  
- Port customization integration test: ‚ùå FAILING (needs debug)
