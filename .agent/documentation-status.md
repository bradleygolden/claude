## No Major Work Required

The documentation appears to be release-ready for 0.6.0. The previous work done on this branch has been thorough and comprehensive.

## Minor Recommendations (Optional)

1. Consider adding a visual diagram of the plugin system architecture
2. Could add more troubleshooting examples for plugin development
3. Might benefit from a "common patterns" section in the quickstart

But none of these are blockers for release - the current documentation is excellent.
