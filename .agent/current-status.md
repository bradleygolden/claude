# Current Status Analysis

After exploring the project structure, I can see that **most of the 0.6.0 release documentation work has already been completed**. 

## Key Findings

### Documentation Already Complete
Based on the grep results and existing files, the following documentation is already in place:

1. **README.md** - Contains plugin system features, SessionEnd hooks, and reporter system
2. **CHANGELOG.md** - Has 0.6.0 release section with all key features  
3. **documentation/guide-plugins.md** - Comprehensive plugin guide exists
4. **documentation/guide-hooks.md** - Updated with SessionEnd hooks and reporter system
5. **cheatsheets/plugins.cheatmd** - Plugin cheat sheet exists
6. **cheatsheets/hooks.cheatmd** - Updated with SessionEnd examples

### .agent Directory Already Exists
Multiple completion reports and audit summaries exist in `.agent/` indicating this work was previously done:
- completion-summary.md
- documentation-audit-complete.md
- final-audit-completion.md
- And many others

### Key Features Documented
1. **Plugin System** - Base, ClaudeCode, Phoenix, Webhook, Logging plugins
2. **Reporter System** - Webhook and JSONL event logging
3. **SessionEnd Hook** - New hook event for cleanup tasks
4. **URL Documentation References** - @reference system with caching

## Next Steps
I need to:
1. Review the current state to see if any updates are needed
2. Check if this is a final audit task rather than initial documentation
3. Verify all documentation is accurate and complete
