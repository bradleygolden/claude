# Claude 0.6.0 Documentation Audit Plan

## Current Status Assessment

After reviewing the codebase, I can see that most of the 0.6.0 documentation has already been completed. Here's what I found:

### ‚úÖ Already Complete

1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Has complete 0.6.0 section with all new features documented
2. **README.md** - Already includes plugin system features, reporting system, and SessionEnd hooks
3. **documentation/guide-plugins.md** - Comprehensive plugin development guide exists
4. **documentation/guide-hooks.md** - Updated with SessionEnd hooks and reporter system
5. **cheatsheets/plugins.cheatmd** - Complete quick reference for plugins

### üîç Need to Check/Update

1. **mix.exs** - ExDoc configuration may need updates for new modules
2. **Other guides** - Review for any missing 0.6.0 references
3. **Module docs** - Ensure new plugin and reporter modules have good documentation

## Key 0.6.0 Features Already Documented

- ‚úÖ Plugin System (Base, ClaudeCode, Phoenix, Webhook, Logging plugins)
- ‚úÖ Reporter System (Webhook and JSONL event logging)
- ‚úÖ SessionEnd Hook Event

## Remaining Tasks
