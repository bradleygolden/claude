### ðŸš€ 0.6.0 Features Documented

All the major 0.6.0 features are already well-documented:

- **Reporter System** - Both webhook and JSONL reporters with custom reporter guide
- **SessionEnd Hook** - Usage patterns and integration examples

## Next Steps

Since the documentation is already complete, I should:
1. Review other guides/cheatsheets to ensure consistency
2. Check if mix.exs ExDoc configuration needs updates
3. Create a commit documenting this audit

This demonstrates excellent documentation hygiene - the 0.6.0 features were documented as they were developed.
