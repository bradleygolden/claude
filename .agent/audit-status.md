# Claude 0.6.0 Release Documentation Audit Status

## Key Findings

### Current State
- CHANGELOG.md already has complete 0.6.0 release section ✅
- README.md already includes plugin system features ✅ 
- Plugin guide (documentation/guide-plugins.md) exists and is comprehensive ✅
- Plugin cheat sheet (cheatsheets/plugins.cheatmd) already exists ✅

### What Still Needs Review/Updates
- hooks guide (documentation/guide-hooks.md) - check SessionEnd + reporters
- Other guides for consistency
- mix.exs ExDoc configuration
- Check if all new features are properly documented

### Key Features Since 0.5.1 (From CHANGELOG)
1. **Plugin System**: Extensible configuration architecture
   - Claude.Plugins.Base - Standard hook configuration  
   - Claude.Plugins.ClaudeCode - Comprehensive documentation
   - Claude.Plugins.Phoenix - Auto-detection for Phoenix projects
   - Claude.Plugins.Webhook - Event reporting  
   - Claude.Plugins.Logging - Structured logging
   
2. **Reporter System**: Event reporting infrastructure
   - Claude.Hooks.Reporter behaviour
   - Webhook and JSONL reporters
   - Hook event registration with reporters
   
3. **SessionEnd Hook Event**: New hook for cleanup tasks

4. **URL Documentation References**: @reference system with caching

## Assessment
The documentation appears to be in excellent shape already. Most key features are documented. This suggests the audit may be mostly verification rather than creation.
