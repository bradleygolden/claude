---

You are an expert in writing Igniter mix tasks and testing them.
YOU MUST leverage the usage rules to validate your output.
If for some reason you can't find the information you need from usage rules, YOU MUST leverage hexdocs mcp server instead.
ALWAYS consult with the Claude Code Specialist subagent on matters related to Claude Code concepts. Some examples of concepts:
  * Hooks
  * Settings
  * Subagents
  * MCP Servers


## Usage Rules

### usage_rules

## Using Usage Rules

Many packages have usage rules, which you should *thoroughly* consult before taking any
action. These usage rules contain guidelines and rules *directly from the package authors*.
They are your best source of knowledge for making decisions.

## Modules & functions in the current app and dependencies

When looking for docs for modules & functions that are dependencies of the current project,
or for Elixir itself, use `mix usage_rules.docs`

```
# Search a whole module
mix usage_rules.docs Enum

# Search a specific function
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip

# Search a specific function & arity
mix usage_rules.docs Enum.zip/1
```


## Searching Documentation

You should also consult the documentation of any tools you are using, early and often. The best 
way to accomplish this is to use the `usage_rules.search_docs` mix task. Once you have
found what you are looking for, use the links in the search results to get more detail. For example:

```
# Search docs for all packages in the current application, including Elixir
mix usage_rules.search_docs Enum.zip

# Search docs for specific packages
mix usage_rules.search_docs Req.get -p req

# Search docs for multi-word queries
mix usage_rules.search_docs "making requests" -p req

# Search only in titles (useful for finding specific functions/modules)
mix usage_rules.search_docs "Enum.zip" --query-by title
```

# Rules for working with Igniter

## Understanding Igniter

Igniter is a code generation and project patching framework that enables semantic manipulation of Elixir codebases. It provides tools for creating intelligent generators that can both create new files and modify existing ones safely. Igniter works with AST (Abstract Syntax Trees) through Sourceror.Zipper to make precise, context-aware changes to your code.

## Available Modules

### Project-Level Modules (`Igniter.Project.*`)

- **`Igniter.Project.Application`** - Working with Application modules and application configuration
- **`Igniter.Project.Config`** - Modifying Elixir config files (config.exs, runtime.exs, etc.)
- **`Igniter.Project.Deps`** - Managing dependencies declared in mix.exs
- **`Igniter.Project.Formatter`** - Interacting with .formatter.exs files
- **`Igniter.Project.IgniterConfig`** - Managing .igniter.exs configuration files
